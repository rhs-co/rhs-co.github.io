                <h1 class="display-4 text-center mb-4" data-aos="fade-up">What is Dropshipping?</h1>

                <div class="bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-4" data-aos="fade-up">
                    <h2 class="h4">The Concept</h2>
                    <p>A dropship business is one wherein an e-commerce store peddles items without ever having
                        possession of them. Instead of on-hand actual goods, a store takes order(s) from an interested
                        customer, and then has to procure the item from a company or wholesaler or manufacturer only
                        after acquiring an order from the customer. After such a purchase, a supplier directly ships the
                        item to that customer, thus eliminating the need for an owner/store to possess such an item or
                        even handle its fulfillment.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-4" data-aos="fade-up">
                    <h2 class="h4">How it Works</h2>
                    <p>So the store-keeper means just an intermediary in such a model-type business. Whenever any order
                        is placed by the customer, that storekeeper purchases that very item from the supplier and then
                        asks the supplier to ship it to the customer. It allows the business owner to run their online
                        store without investing into keeping any kind of stock or dealing with shipping logistics.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-4" data-aos="fade-up">
                    <h2 class="h4">Dropshipping vs. Reselling</h2>
                    <p>However, the big difference is between dropshipping and reselling. Reselling means buying
                        products and then selling them. In case of dropshipping, the supplier will have a mutual
                        agreement because, with most cases of dropshipping, a contract presents between both parties to
                        streamline the entire process of product sourcing and fulfillment. You're likely to face the
                        downside of disrupted product relevancy in terms of supply, delayed shipping, and inconsistent
                        quality if you go on buying only from the supplier after a sale without any formal contract.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-4" data-aos="fade-up">
                    <h2 class="h4">Challenges of Dropshipping</h2>
                    <p>Dropshipping has its own challenges, low startup costs, flexibility, and lower margins; as profit
                        margins depend entirely on third-party suppliers and competition in the market. Weak
                        partnerships with suppliers can also make things worse with shipping delays and issues related
                        to quality.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm" data-aos="fade-up">
                    <h2 class="h4">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>To summarize, dropshipping is the easiest way to begin a business without investing significantly
                        upfront; supplier management can cause problems if proper sessions are not held to explain their
                        duties in meeting customers' satisfaction. Without formal arrangements with suppliers, it may be
                        challenging to maintain quality service and reliability.</p>

        <section class="mb-5" data-aos="fade-up">
            <h2 class="h3 mb-3">1. Supplier Agreement</h2>
            <p>As the supplier, you will specify which of your products are available for dropshipping. You will also
                outline any specific conditions or requirements for these products. This includes information on product
                availability, shipping terms, and any additional preferences you may have. We can discuss any
                adjustments to these terms as needed.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-5" data-aos="fade-up">
            <h2 class="h3 mb-3">2. Website Agreement</h2>
            <p>In this step, we will agree on the desired domain name (if you have a preference), as well as any special
                design requirements or branding preferences for the website. You can provide input on the overall look
                and feel, functionality, and any specific features you’d like the site to have. If you have additional
                specifications for the site’s operation, we will incorporate those into the development plan.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-5" data-aos="fade-up">
            <h2 class="h3 mb-3">3. Pricing Agreement</h2>
            <p>Pricing for the products on the website will be determined through a transparent agreement, where the
                final <strong>price on the website</strong> will be calculated as follows:</p>
            <pre
                class="bg-light p-3">Price on the website = Supplier's base price + markup + hosting fee + commission</pre>
            <p>The markup structure is as follows:</p>
            <ul class="list-group mb-3">
                <li class="list-group-item">Products priced up to $10: markup of 80% (subject to changes)</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Products priced up to $100: markup of 20%</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Products priced up to $1000: markup of 5%</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Products priced above $1000: markup of 1%</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The commission ranges from 0.1% to 3% + $0.30 per transaction, depending on the payment method. The
                hosting fee
                is set at $2.50 per month.</p>

            <h2 class="h3 mb-3">5. Website Development & Hosting Setup</h2>
            <p>Website development and hosting setup typically takes 1 to 7 days, depending on the complexity of the
                design and features required. We will ensure the website is fully functional and ready for customer
                orders.</p>

            <h2 class="h3 mb-3">6. Full Cooperation Launch</h2>
            <p>Once everything is set up, we will move into full cooperation mode. When a customer places an order, the
                details of the order, including the payment, will be forwarded directly to the supplier (you). As the
                supplier, you will be responsible for shipping the product directly to the customer. Payment will be
                processed through an agreed-upon method or, if necessary, we will manually place the order with you and
                provide all the required details.</p>
            <p>In case of any issues, such as wrong shipments, product defects, or any other problems, we will
